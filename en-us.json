  "LORITTA_ADDED_ON_SERVER": "Howdy {0}, how are you? I hope your day is being excellent! ✧ﾟ･: *ヽ(◕ヮ◕ヽ)\n\nI don''t know if it was you or somebody else that added me in {1}, but, because you have Administrator (or manage server) permission I thought it was a good idea to talk about me. <:loritta:331179879582269451>\n\nMy name is Loritta and I''m just a simple bot for Discord! My objective is to make your server more 👌🔥🔝 with more entertainment, better administration and with stuff that you *never* seen in other bots!\n\nWell... Enough blabbing about nothing! Let me talk about some stuff that maybe you will like. 😉\n\n• By default my prefix is `+`, try using `+ping` in your server to be sure that I''m working!\n• If you want to change/enable/disable my features, then go to my panel! {2}\n• If you need help, if you want to report bugs, if you want to suggest something or if you just want to talk about me, why not visit my apartament? 😊 {3}\n• I have a bunch of commands (If you wanna know, I have **{4} different commands**!), if you want to know every single one of them, use *help* in this chat!\n• You can send new YouTube videos of an YouTube channel directly on your server! (Also... did you know that I do notify new videos faster than YouTube itself? 😉) Just go to my panel and configure that!\n\n...seriously, my panel has everything and a bit more, go check it out! {2}\n\n**Tip from <:loritta:331179879582269451>, the brunette of the neighborhood:** If you have a bit of money laying around, then please donate! <{5}> Did you know it costs 260R$ per month to keep me online? So... do you know that hamburger that is a bit moldy that you always buy... instead of buying that moldy stuff, you could donate to me so I could stay online for more days! 😊",
